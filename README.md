# ModbusBox Manifest File
Official ModbusBox Manifest File


## Description

The manifest file serves as a map of the slaves that the ModbusBox will be able to read and control. The ModbusBox firmware includes the official manifest with all existing slaves at the time of compilation. The user can import and export this file through the user interface.
